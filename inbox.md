  - 1.4-M3 - tried to migrate - result is not quite successful
    - Seems like symbols need to be resolved through plugin context api
    - Requires deeper migration of the plugin and maybe changes to compiler (which won't land until 1.4.20)
    - JS is blocked by this
    - Changes in 1.4-M3 on [[server-side]]
