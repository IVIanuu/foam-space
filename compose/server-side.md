# Compose on server side

Connecting node changes on server to js nodes through websocket.
The project is pretty much barebone currently, we'll see how it goes.

Project is split into multiple phases:
  - [x] Establish base behaviours of events / nodes and connection to server
  - [x] Separate library and sandbox
  - [x] Pass values with events to enable behaviours like input changes
  - [ ] Pass attribute updates as a result of those events
  - [ ] Enable passing css along with composable components
  - [ ] Standardise API to make it more flexible
