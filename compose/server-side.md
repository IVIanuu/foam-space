# Compose on server side

[Repository](https://github.com/ShikaSD/compose-server-side)

Connecting node changes on server to js nodes through websocket.
The project is pretty much barebone currently, we'll see how it goes.

Project is split into multiple phases:
  - [x] Establish base behaviours of events / nodes and connection to server
  - [x] Separate library and sandbox
  - [x] Pass values with events to enable behaviours like input changes
  - [x] Pass attribute updates as a result of those events
  - [x] Enable passing css along with composable components
  - [x] Standardise API to make it more flexible
  - [ ] Cool demo lol
